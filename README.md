# Pathway Commons Guide: Workflows

## Overview

This repository is part of the [Pathway Commons Guide](http://pathwaycommons.github.io/guide/). It contains code that support several  [workflows](http://pathwaycommons.github.io/guide/workflows/archive/) for biological pathway analysis.

## Available workflows

1. [Pathway Enrichment - Custom](http://pathwaycommons.github.io/guide/workflows/pathway_enrichment_custom/index/)
  - Use your own RNA sequencing data generated from a custom experimental setup
2. [Pathway Enrichment - GDC](http://pathwaycommons.github.io/guide/workflows/pathway_enrichment_gdc/index/)
  - Use RNA sequencing data provided by a large cancer genome consortium (The Cancer Genome Atlas).
