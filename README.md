# Pathway Commons Guide: Workflows

## Overview

This repository is part of the [Pathway Commons Guide](http://pathwaycommons.github.io/guide/). It contains code that support several  [workflows](http://pathwaycommons.github.io/guide/workflows/archive/) for biological pathway analysis.

## Workflows

1. [Pathway Enrichment - Custom](http://pathwaycommons.github.io/guide/workflows/pathway_enrichment_custom/index/)
  - Use RNA sequencing data generated by your experimental system in a pair-wise comparison.
2. [Pathway Enrichment - GDC](http://pathwaycommons.github.io/guide/workflows/pathway_enrichment_gdc/index/)
  - Use RNA sequencing data from ovarian cancers and make a pair-wise comparison between two of the subtypes.
