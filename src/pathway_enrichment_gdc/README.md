# Pathway Enrichment Workflow - GDC

## Overview

This repository is part of the [Pathway Commons Guide](http://pathwaycommons.github.io/guide/). It contains code relevant to the workflow for [Pathway Enrichment GDC](http://pathwaycommons.github.io/guide/workflows/pathway_enrichment_gdc/index/). Sections of the workflow are described here.

1. [Get Data](http://pathwaycommons.github.io/guide/workflows/pathway_enrichment_gdc/get_data/): We source high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGS-OvCa) RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data generated by [The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)](https://cancergenome.nih.gov/) effort and housed at the [Genonomic Data Commons (GDC)](https://gdc.cancer.gov/).
2. [Process Data](http://pathwaycommons.github.io/guide/workflows/pathway_enrichment_gdc/process_data/): The data are analyzed for differential expression between HGS-OvCa subtypes and the genes are ranked accordingly. The ranks are the input for an [enrichment analysis performed using GSEA](http://pathwaycommons.github.io/guide/workflows/pathway_enrichment_gdc/identify_pathways/)
3. [Visualize](http://pathwaycommons.github.io/guide/workflows/pathway_enrichment_gdc/visualize/): The output of GSEA is visualized using an [Enrichment Map](http://apps.cytoscape.org/apps/enrichmentmap). Data formatted as part of this step are optional inputs for an Enrichment Map visualization.
