# Pathway Enrichment Workflow

## Overview

This repository is part of the [Pathway Commons Guide](http://pathwaycommons.github.io/guide/). It contains code relevant to the [Pathway Enrichment - Custom](http://pathwaycommons.github.io/guide/workflows/pathway_enrichment_custom/index/) workflow.

In practical terms, this repository provides a web app that can be run inside of R Studio. The app walks a user through the steps required to 'upload' RNA Sequencing metadata and data then automatically generates all the required files for a [Gene Set Enrichment Analysis](http://pathwaycommons.github.io/guide/workflows/pathway_enrichment_gdc/identify_pathways/) and visualizing these results via an [Enrichment Map](http://apps.cytoscape.org/apps/enrichmentmap).
